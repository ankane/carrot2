# Carrot2

Ruby client for [Carrot2](https://github.com/carrot2/carrot2) - the open-source document clustering server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ankane/carrot2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ankane/carrot2)

## Installation

First, [download and run](https://github.com/carrot2/carrot2#installation) the Carrot2 server.

With Homebrew, use:

```sh
brew install carrot2
brew services start carrot2
```

Then add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'carrot2'
```

The latest version works with Carrot2 4. For Carrot2 3, use version 0.2.1 and [this readme](https://github.com/ankane/carrot2/blob/v0.2.1/README.md).

## How to Use

To cluster documents, use:

```ruby
documents = [
  "Sign up for an exclusive coupon.",
  "Exclusive members get a free coupon.",
  "Coupons are going fast.",
  "This is completely unrelated to the other documents."
]

carrot2 = Carrot2.new
carrot2.cluster(documents)
```

This returns:

```ruby
{
  "clusters" => [
    {
      "labels" => ["Coupon"],
      "documents" => [0, 1, 2],
      "clusters" => [],
      "score" => 0.06418006702675011
    },
    {
      "labels" => ["Exclusive"],
      "documents" => [0, 1],
      "clusters" => [],
      "score" => 0.7040290701763807
    }
  ]
}
```

Documents are numbered in the order provided, starting with 0.

```ruby
carrot2.cluster(documents, language: "FRENCH")
```

Specify an algorithm with:

```ruby
carrot2.cluster(documents, algorithm: "Lingo")
